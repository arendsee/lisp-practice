# Lisp

A decade ago I asked a friend what language I should learn. At the time I knew
nothing. I thought UNIX was a language. I had no idea what an operating system
was. I didn't know what questions to ask.

The friend's answer, being a jobless troglodyte practicioner arcana, was of
course Lisp.

I spent a few days playing with the language in some Windows-based interpreter
GUI, then gave up. I wanted something. I didn't know the words. But I wanted
something deeper. I wanted to see the machine. I wanted to build "real"
programs, whatever they were. I didn't want to write into some GUI and have
results echoed to a window.

But I digress. Years and many languages later, after repeatedly choosing other
languages, I am finally opening a repository for study of this language. I am
also opening one for ML, which I suppose I will learn in tandem. And of course,
I have ongoing projects in Haskell and Prolog. Perhaps depth would be
preferable to breadth, however, I need at least some basis in all these
languages to be really conversant in computer science.

My intention here is not to become fluent in Lisp, but simply to gain a rough
familiarity.
